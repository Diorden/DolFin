DolFin is a financial-management web application that allows you to control where your money goes and track spending habits and possible money sinks. 
I want to implement features that enable the flow of money between accounts in response to certain event triggers, as well as debt tracking, budget calculators and more, but for now I need to get the program both functional and presentable.

This is a personal project I've been working on since mid August. 
I am in the need of a program that could help me manage my finances and help control my spending habits, and I wish to start building projects to help me grow as a programmer. This seemed like a good place to start.

I aim to have basic functionality down by the end of September. And yes, the 3-bit CSS color scheme is gouhlish and unprofessional. Not a priority for now.

A version of this program can be found at https://diorden.neocities.org/dolfin/dolfinblog, which I keep up to date in parallel with the version in this repository.
